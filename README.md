# Arkanoid-Game

 ## Introduction
   As part of an OOP course we were given a task to teach us different elements:
* Use of polymorphism and inheritance.
* Familiarity with basic design patterns in OOP such as decorator, observer and factory design patterns.
* Using java collections and data structures.
* Using Java I/O to read and write files(saving the high-scores of players across different games).
* Creating game levels based on human-readable text files.
* keep open/closed principle states.
* Working with GUI.

## My Project:
   In this project we created a version of the old and familiar game.
   I added different levels with different difficulties.
   I also created a file who saves the high-scores of players across different games.
   
## Playing the game:
   In order to play the game, download the 'ArkanoidGame.jar' file to your computer and run it:
   Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux\macOS) in the directory where you downloaded the file and enter the command:
   
      java -jar ass7game.jar
   
   The game is played with the left and right arrows on your keyboard.
