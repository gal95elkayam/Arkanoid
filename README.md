# Arkanoid-Game

 ## Introduction
    As part of an OOP course we were given a task to teach us different elements:
* Use of polymorphism and inheritance.
* Familiarity with basic design patterns in OOP such as decorator, observer and factory design patterns.
* Using java collections and data structures.
* Using Java I/O to read and write files(saving the high-scores of players across different games).
* Creating game levels based on human-readable text files.
* keep open/closed principle states.
* Working with GUI.

## My Project:
    In this project we created a version of the old and familiar game.
    I added different levels with different difficulties.
    I also created a file who saves the high-scores of players across different games.
